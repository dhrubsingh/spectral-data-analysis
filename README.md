## Spectral Data Analysis API

# Astronomical Research Library

Package: https://test.pypi.org/project/spectral-data-analysis-Tempestly18/


## Overview

This library assists in astronomical research, focusing on classifying stars, galaxies, and QSOs. It interfaces with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) services for spectral data access.

### Key Features

- Data Preprocessing: Normalization, outlier removal, interpolation, redshift correction.
- Metadata Extraction: Extracts various astronomical data fields.
- Spectral Alignment: Aligns wavelengths with interpolation.
- Visualization: Matplotlib-based spectral visualization.
- Data Augmentation: Derivative computations for spectra.
- Additional Modules: Cross-matching, machine learning classification, interactive visualization, spectral feature extraction.

## Installation

```bash
git clone [repository URL]
cd [project directory]
pip install .
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

```python
from astronomical_research import StarGalaxyQSOClassifier
classifier = StarGalaxyQSOClassifier()
query = "SELECT * FROM sdss WHERE ..."
results = classifier.classify(query)
```

### Visualization

```python
from astronomical_research import visualize_spectrum
visualize_spectrum(spectrum_data)
```
